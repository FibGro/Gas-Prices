# Gas-Prices

Our objective in this study is to build models based on the time-series dataset of the Henry Hub natural gas price and create a two-year forecast by using different time series models in R programming. 

# Dataset Information 

The dataset is collected from [the US Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/rngwhhdm.htm). The dataset consists of monthly Henry Hub natural gas spot prices starting from January 1997 until March 2022. The price is denominated by US dollar Metric Million British thermal unit (US$/MMBtu). Prices are based on delivery at the Henry Hub in Louisiana. Official daily closing prices at 2:30 p.m. from the trading floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) for a specific delivery month [(EIA, 2020).](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/NG_PRI_FUT_S1_M.htm)
